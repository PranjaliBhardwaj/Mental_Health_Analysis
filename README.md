# Self-Analysis Mental Health Model
## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a Self-Analysis Mental Health Model that predicts possible mental health conditions based on user-provided symptoms. The model is designed for seamless integration into a chatbot or an application, with a focus on accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency. A simple UI/CLI is provided for testing and interaction.

## Features

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and standardizing numerical values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying relationships between symptoms and mental health conditions.

Model Development: Training multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) and selecting the best performer.

Model Evaluation: Using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics.

Explainability: Implementing SHAP and LIME for model interpretability.

Inference & UI: Providing an inference script and a UI/CLI for user interaction.
